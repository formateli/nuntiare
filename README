Nuntiare (Report in latin) is a report toolkit written in python. 
It is inspired by RDL (report definition language) specifications, 
but simplified and adapted to Python world.


============
At a glance
============

- Reports are defined using xml files.
- Xml definition files are processed to generate reports. 
  Nuntiare can connect to any database (modules implementing API 2.0) for data gathering.
- Reports can be saved as nuntiare files for later usage.
- Nuntiare defines a render API that can be implemented to develop custom ones.
  Nuntiare comes with following renders: pdf, png and svg (based on cairo), html, csv and xml.
- It comes with a comand line tool (nuntiare). 
  It can run commands like 'render' (render to especific type), 
  'convert' (converts rdl 2008 to nuntiare), etc.
