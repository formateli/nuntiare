Usage
-----

The best way of knowing nuntiare is trough its command line tool.

For help::

    nuntiare -h

or::

    nuntiare render -h

Process myreport.xml (report definition file) and renders it to 
myreport.html and myreport.pdf::

    nuntiare render myreport.xml -r html pdf

Process myreport.xml and saves it as myreport.nuntiare (with data appended)::

    nuntiare render myreport.xml --save

Process myreport.nuntiare and renders it to pdf.
This file has tha data appended to it, 
if database connection fails then data is loaded from it.::

    nuntiare render myreport.nuntiare -r pdf

Process myreport.xml passing two parameters, user and city, 
and then renders it to html.::

    nuntiare render myreport.xml -p user=framirez city=panama -r html

Converts myreport.rdl (Rdl 2008) to myreport.xml (nuntiare report definition). It is an experimental feature.::

    nuntiare convert myreport.rdl
