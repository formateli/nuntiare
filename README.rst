It is inspired by RDL (report definition language) specifications, 
but simplified and adapted to Python world.

  Nuntiare can connect to any database (modules implementing API 2.0) for data gathering.
- Reports can be saved as nuntiare files for later usage.
- Nuntiare defines a render API that can be implemented to develop custom ones.
  Nuntiare comes with following renders: pdf, png and svg (based on cairo), html, csv and xml.
- It comes with a comand line tool *(nuntiare)*.
